The **Stock Performance** dashboard tracks monthly inventory levels for the furniture business throughout 2025, showing fluctuating but generally declining stock quantities. The data begins with **10,133 units in January**, followed by **10,000 units in February**, indicating a slight 133-unit decrease. March sees a more significant drop to **8,267 units**, continuing downward to **6,400 units in April**. The decline accelerates in May with **4,533 units**, then plunges to **2,667 units in June** - the steepest single-month decrease of 1,866 units. July reaches a critical low of just **800 units**, suggesting potential stockout risks. However, August shows a partial recovery to **4,000 units**, likely due to successful restocking efforts, before settling at **3,000 units in September**. This pattern reveals three distinct phases: gradual reduction from January to June (losing 7,466 units total), a July inventory crisis, followed by partial replenishment in late Q3. The data highlights particular vulnerability in June-July when inventory fell by 71% month-over-month, while the August rebound demonstrates the business's capacity to recover stock levels when needed. These fluctuations may reflect seasonal demand patterns, supply chain challenges, or inventory management adjustments. For comprehensive analysis, this data should be compared with sales records, supplier performance metrics, and seasonal forecasts to optimize inventory planning and prevent future shortages while avoiding overstocking during slower periods. The dashboard effectively visualizes these critical inventory transitions, enabling data-driven decisions about procurement timing and quantities.
