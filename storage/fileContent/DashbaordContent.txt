(e.g., nearing the **$10,000 lower bound**). This data is crucial for financial planning, as it helps businesses identify seasonal trends,
anticipate cash shortages, and ensure sufficient liquidity for operations. For actionable insights, the cashflow trends should be compared
with sales and expense reports to pinpoint drivers of volatility and inform strategic adjustments. The combination of visual trends and
alert thresholds offers a proactive approach to financial management, supporting stability and growth.

The **Stock Performance** dashboard tracks monthly inventory levels for the furniture business throughout 2025,
showing fluctuating but generally declining stock quantities. The data begins with **10,133 units in January**, followed by **10,000 units in February**,
indicating a slight 133-unit decrease. March sees a more significant drop to **8,267 units**, continuing downward to **6,400 units in April**.
The decline accelerates in May with **4,533 units**, then plunges to **2,667 units in June** - the steepest single-month decrease of 1,866 units.
July reaches a critical low of just **800 units**, suggesting potential stockout risks. However, August shows a partial recovery to **4,000 units**,
likely due to successful restocking efforts, before settling at **3,000 units in September**. This pattern reveals three distinct phases:
gradual reduction from January to June (losing 7,466 units total), a July inventory crisis, followed by partial replenishment in late Q3.
The data highlights particular vulnerability in June-July when inventory fell by 71% month-over-month,
while the August rebound demonstrates the business's capacity to recover stock levels when needed.
These fluctuations may reflect seasonal demand patterns, supply chain challenges, or inventory management adjustments.
For comprehensive analysis, this data should be compared with sales records, supplier performance metrics,
and seasonal forecasts to optimize inventory planning and prevent future shortages while avoiding overstocking during slower periods.
The dashboard effectively visualizes these critical inventory transitions, enabling data-driven decisions about procurement timing and quantities.

'Seasonal Demand Comparison':
This chart represents a year-over-year comparison of seasonal demand across four seasons:
Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter. It visualizes the number of units sold in each season for two consecutive years,
2023 and 2024. In 2023, the demand for products was 320 units in Spring, increased to 450 units in Summer,
slightly decreased to 370 units in Fall, and then peaked at 590 units in Winter. In 2024, the trend shifted slightly with 380 units sold in Spring,
followed by 420 units in Summer, 390 units in Fall, and a higher peak of 640 units in Winter.
This pattern indicates that product demand tends to rise significantly during the winter season,
likely due to higher interest in comfort-related items like sofas during colder months.
The chart uses color coding to differentiate between years and allows interactive tooltips to display the exact unit counts
when hovering over each seasonal bar, making it easy to compare performance between the two years for each season.




'Customer Satisfaction (NPS)':
The Customer Satisfaction Chart is a bar graph that visually represents the Net Promoter Score (NPS) based on recent survey responses.
It categorizes customers into three groups: Promoters, Passives, and Detractors. According to the chart, 68% of customers are Promoters,
indicating a high level of satisfaction and loyalty toward the service or product. Promoters are customers who are most likely to recommend
the company to others. Passives make up 20% of the respondents; these customers are moderately satisfied but not enthusiastic enough to promote the brand,
 making them vulnerable to switching to competitors. Finally, 12% of customers are Detractors,
 which means they are dissatisfied and may negatively impact the brand through unfavorable word-of-mouth. The chart uses vibrant,
 distinctive colors—green for Promoters, yellow for Passives, and red for Detractors—to clearly distinguish between each category.
 The values are displayed as percentages, both on the bars and in tooltips when hovering over each bar.
 This chart helps businesses understand customer loyalty and satisfaction at a glance,
 making it easier to prioritize improvements and customer engagement strategies based on feedback distribution.



'Return Reasons Overview':
The Return Reasons Chart presents an analysis of the top causes for product returns based on customer feedback.
The chart is displayed as a horizontal bar graph with five distinct categories. The leading reason for returns is "Wrong Size,"
which accounts for 120 returned items, indicating a significant sizing issue in product offerings. The second most common reason is
"Damaged Item," with 90 items returned due to receiving products in unsatisfactory or broken condition. "Late Delivery" follows with 60 returns,
suggesting delays in the shipping process contribute notably to customer dissatisfaction. "Changed Mind" is the fourth reason,
resulting in 40 returns where customers simply reconsidered their purchases. Lastly, "Wrong Item Sent" is responsible for 30 returns,
highlighting occasional fulfillment errors. Each reason is color-coded—Wrong Size in pink (#FF6384), Damaged Item in orange (#FFA726),
Late Delivery in blue (#36A2EB), Changed Mind in teal (#4BC0C0), and Wrong Item Sent in purple (#9966FF).
The chart uses a modern design with soft shadows, rounded bars, and displays the quantity of returns directly on each bar for clarity.
This breakdown helps businesses understand which operational or customer experience areas need the most improvement to reduce return rates.



'Delivery Time Histogram':
The Delivery Time Histogram provides a detailed breakdown of how many deliveries occurred for each specific delivery duration, measured in days.
For deliveries completed in 1 day, there were 13 deliveries, which represents one of the highest frequencies in the dataset. 2-day
deliveries accounted for 11 deliveries, matching the counts for both 3-day and 4-day deliveries, which also recorded 11 deliveries each.
The number of deliveries that took 5 days dropped slightly to 10 deliveries. The lowest number of deliveries occurred in the 6-day category,
where only 6 deliveries were completed, indicating a possible bottleneck or issue during this timeframe. Delivery counts picked up again at 7 days,
with 11 deliveries, and then slightly decreased for 8-day and 9-day durations, each of which had 7 deliveries. Finally, 10-day deliveries surged back
to 13 deliveries, tying with 1-day deliveries for the highest count. This detailed distribution reveals a bimodal pattern, where extremely fast (1 day)
and slower (10 days) deliveries are most common, while mid-range durations (especially 6 to 9 days) are less frequent, with 6 days being the least common.



'Revenue by Category':
